//Whether const references can be converted into uPy objects.
//Conversion to a uPy object is normally the case only if it's returned/passed by value
//since that properly mathces the copy semantics: everytime we convert a supported type from
//it's native value into a uPy object we effectively make a distinct copy.
//However for performance reasons we allow const references as well when UPYWRAP_PASSCONSTREF is 1:
//this allows not having to make the extra unused copy of the native argument which is made
//when passing by value.
//Note this does kinda breaks semantics: the uPy object does not reference the native object
//in any way so users have to take care not to use it as such

//Whether to use shared_ptr instead of raw pointers for the actual storage of all native types.
//Per default this is on since passing around raw pointers quickly
//leads to undefined behavior when garbage collection comes into play.
//For example, consider this, where X and Y are both created With ClassWrapper,
//and Y::Store() takes an X* or X& and keeps a pointer to it internally:
//
//  y = Y()
//  y.Store( X() )
//  gc.collect()
//
//The last line will get rid of the ClassWrapper instance for the X object
//(since gc can't find a corresponding py object anymore as that was not stored;
//with actual py objects this wouldn't happen), so now y has a pointer to a deleted X.
//The only proper way around is using shared_ptr instead: if ClassWrapper has a
//shared_ptr< X >, Store takes a shared_ptr< X > (which it should do after all
//if it's planning to keep the argument longer then the function scope) and
//we pass a copy of ClassWrapper's object to Store, all is fine: when deleting
//the garbage collected object, shared_ptr's destructor is called but the object
//is not deleted unless there are no references anymore.

//Require exact type matches when converting uPy objects into native ones.

//However when your application wants to passs pointers to derived classes to functions
//taking base class pointers this has to be turned off.
//Note: this requires C++ type information. For gcc (and possibly others) this means that it
//doesn't work with -fno-rtti because that makes typeid() unavailable; which striclty speaking
//shouldn't be because typeid() could work fine on types known at compile-time, as we use it.
//Following that reasoning as well, msvc has no problems with it.
//Not turned off automatically in case of !UPYWRAP_HAS_TYPEID because we want users to
